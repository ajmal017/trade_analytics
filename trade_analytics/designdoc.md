1. Database optimization --> primary key, indices
2. Abstract model class to be inherited
3. files in your app --> libs.py, tasks.py, models.py, views.py
4. class based views
5. use messages
6. use assert
7. use exceptions
8. use logging
9. use test everywhere
10. design for multi threading 
10. Easily Switch between celery and multiprocessing
11. defined an initial initializer database... for a fresh restart
12.  Keep apps always as independent as possible
13.  django-datascience app --> Independent re-usable app only for Machine learning based computations and data staorage/visualize
14.                         --> separate database
14.                         --> make chart templates in javascript/bokeh/matplotlib
14.                         --> make template dashboards
15.                         --> only used for doing data science and visualizations
16.                         --> interactive : form to select data type of columns
15. raise 404 pages from view with clearn message
16. should contain multiple try excepts to capture the right error and serve the right error
17. Each request served by a class-based view has an independent state; therefore, it is safe to store state variables on the instance (i.e., self.foo = 3 is a thread-safe operation). Arguments passed to a view are shared between every instance of a view. This means that you shouldnâ€™t use a list, dictionary, or any other mutable object as an argument to a view. If you do and the shared object is modified, the actions of one user visiting your view could have an effect on subsequent users visiting the same view.
18.  task progress bar rest api
19.  all compute tasks in computeapp, all logs of task progress in compute app
20.  queryapp only deals with maintaining features
21.  dataapp has the mongodb model to save feature data
22.  dataapp also has data from all other sources like quandl
23.  stockapp only has meta information of stocks
24.  datascience model has to be standalone as much as possible
25.  charts module also has to be as standalone as possible
