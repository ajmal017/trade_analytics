# ToDo


- Make charting better:
	- I want to plot features for a given stock and multiple ones. Live computed features that I dont want to save, just want to see
	- Should be able to do that for multiple number of stocks
	- Use tasks to compute the charts

- Make features compute better
	- register features before it self
	- recompute features or just fill in the missing
	- compute model predictions and save them to db
